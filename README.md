# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Using the Kickstarter dataset that we’ve already combed through, we’ll visualize     campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
Organize, sort, analyze crowdfunding data to determine outcomes based on goals and     outcomes based on launch date.
## Analysis and Challenges
1. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    - [PivotTable](../main/Resources/PivotTable_OutcomesBasedOnLaunchDate.png)
2. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
3. Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

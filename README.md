# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Using the [Kickstarter dataset](../main/data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx) that we’ve already combed through, we’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
Organize, sort, analyze crowdfunding data to determine outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date. 
Refer to [Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx](../main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx).
## Analysis and Challenges
1. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    - [PivotTable 1](../main/Resources/PivotTable_OutcomesBasedOnLaunchDate.png)
    - [PivotChart 1](../main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
2. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    - [PivotTable 2](../main/Resources/PivotTable_OutcomesBasedOnGoals.png)
    - [PivotChart 2](../main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
3. Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    - Filtering columns and clear filter.
    - Place the appropriate pivot table fields in the columns, rows, and values.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - Most successful for May and June.
    - No cancellation for October. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    - The more money goal, the less number successful and failed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Here are two tables and/or graphs that we could create:

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Using the [Kickstarter dataset](../main/data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx) that we’ve already combed through, we’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
  Organize, sort, analyze crowdfunding data to determine outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date. 
  Refer to [Kickstarter_Challenge](../main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx).
## Analysis and Challenges
1. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    - [PivotTable](../main/Resources/PivotTable_OutcomesBasedOnLaunchDate.png)
    - [PivotChart](../main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
2. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    - [PivotTable](../main/Resources/PivotTable_OutcomesBasedOnGoals.png)
    - [PivotChart](../main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
3. Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
